Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts. His only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he has lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine.

    "synopsis": "* Based on a light novel series by Hirasaka Yomi with illustrations by Buriki. Hasegawa Kodaka, a half-Japanese / half-British boy, has recently transferred to a Catholic high school, the St. Chronica`s Academy, and as always, finds it impossible to make friends there due to his naturally blond hair, inherited from his dead English mother, which makes him look like a dangerous delinquent to his prejudiced peers. One day after school, he enters the classroom witnessing the equally solitary and very abrasive girl Mikazuki Yozora while she speaks to her imaginary friend Tomo. They decide that the best way to improve their social standing is to form a club — the Rinjinbu (Neighbour`s Club) — just to make friends and learn social skills. Five other members soon join, starting with the school`s well-connected and arrogant idol Kashiwazaki Sena, who has many male admirers but no female friends due to jealousy. Kusunoki Yukimura, a student often dressed as a maid, who idealises and follows Kodaka in the hope of learning to become manlier. Kobato, Kodaka`s younger sister who is attending St. Chronica`s middle school division and has a penchant for darkness, vampires and the macabre ever since she started watching an anime called Full Metal Necromancer. Shiguma Rika, a perverted underclassman and well-known scientific genius, who speaks in the third person and was saved by Kodaka during a failed experiment, thereafter trying to repay him with sex. And finally Takayama Maria, a precocious 10-year-old teacher and nun at the academy, who becomes the club adviser.",

Motosuwa Hideki is a poor student who failed his entrance exams to get into college. So, Hideki is forced to move to the city, get a job, and attend cram school in hopes of passing the next college entrance exam. He would of course also like to own a Persocon, but is way too poor to afford one. One day, while returning home, he finds a Persocon in a trash heap. However, his new find does not seem to be like the others he has heard about. She does not seem to have an operating system at all, and only says \"Chii\". As Hideki learns more about his Persocon (aptly named Chii), he finds out that she is not of any known type, and is most likely some sort of home-made model. He also learns of an urban legend — the Chobits — Persocons with the ability to think for themselves, instead of just running complex programs...",

Due to hunger and fatigue, she collapses on the street. Much to his embarrassment, he has no choice but to bring the alien he later names Ren, to his apartment, to stay for the night. But she insists on staying, referring to Takeya as \"Master\". Ren learns Japanese overnight due to her race`s high intelligence and linguistic abilities, with some help from Neneko, Takeya`s childhood friend and daughter of the apartment manager. Later, Ren goes on to attend Takeya`s school, where she is mistaken for another DearS exchange student. However, trouble occurs when the real exchange student, Miu, appears.",

His plan succeeds beyond his wildest expectations when the Death Note is found by brilliant high school senior Yagami Light, who is also bored with a world he considers rotten. Although initially he regards the book as a prank, Light soon discovers, through experimentation, that the book`s claim is true: picture a person in your mind as you write the person`s name in the Death Note, and that person dies 40 seconds later of of a heart attack (although a different time frame and manner of death can be specified). Armed with that power, Light sets out on a quest he sees as noble: make the world a better place by eliminating all its criminals using the Death Note. Soon cast as the mysterious \"Kira\" (a Japanese pronunciation of the English \"killer\") in the media and on the Internet, some take exception to his playing god, most notably the police and the enigmatic master detective L, who resolves to do everything in his power to stop Kira. Light counters by doing everything in his power to prevent people from identifying or interfering with him, even if that means getting rid of people investigating him.",

In Bulma`s search, she traveled far and wide, until one day she met a strange but very strong boy with a tail. The boy, Son Gokuu, lived by himself in a small place in the middle of the wilderness. It turns out that Gokuu has a Dragon Ball, but he will not let go of it, no matter what; after all, that Dragon Ball is his only memento of his late grandfather, the man who raised him. Being unused to dealing with other people and never having seen a female his whole life, Gokuu is highly tactless. However, Bulma sees the value of having his strength to protect her in her journey and realises that he won`t let give away his Dragon Ball easily, so she convinces him to go with her. As she seeks the remaining Dragon Balls in order to make her wish come true, he embarks on a quest to see the world and become stronger; thus begins their a journey together, a journey in which they will face many perils and meet many people, friends and foes alike.",

The title is \"Dragon Ball DAIMA\". \"DAIMA\" is a made-up term, which in Japanese characters would be \"大魔\" or in English would be something like \"Evil.\" Due to a conspiracy, Goku and his friends are turned small. In order to fix things, they`ll head off to a new world! It`s a grand adventure with intense action in an unknown and mysterious world. Since Goku has to make up for his petite size, he uses his Nyoibo (Power Pole) to fight, something not seen in a long time. I came up with the story and settings, as well as a lot of the designs. I`m actually putting a lot more into this than usual! Things will unfold that close in on the mysteries of the Dragon Ball world. Hope you all enjoy these different-from-usual battles that are cute and powerful!! -Akira Toriyama",

    "synopsis": "* Based on a fantasy shounen manga series written and illustrated by Mashima Hiro. It was serialized in Kodansha`s Weekly Shonen Magazine from August 2006 to July 2017 with 63 volumes. In 2018 the sequel manga Fairy Tail 100 Years Quest was started. The last year saw major changes for certain parties in Earth Land. First, fueled by the tragic death of his foster father Igneel and the constant battles against the Dark Guild Tartaros, Natsu left to travel the lands with Happy, a renewed determination to become even more powerful lighting his fire. Even more surprising was the disbandment of the Fairy Tail guild, a command which came from Fairy Tail Master Makarov himself without any explanation or prior notice. Much like Natsu and Happy, Makarov`s location was also kept secret. During that time, Lucy landed a job as a reporter. Though she was committed to her work, she also decided to use her skills and resources to gather news of her friends as they moved about the continent. Working away with no real plan, Lucy thought her next big assignment at covering the annual Grand Magic Game would go off without a hitch... until Natsu and Happy make a grand appearance and reunite with her once again. Now, with the revival of Fairy Tail on their minds, Lucy, Natsu, and Happy set out on a new journey to find the rest of their friends and former guildmates to get things back to how they should be.",

The Holy Grail War is a death-match between 7 magi (Masters) and their summoned heroic spirits (Servants). In this battle royale, the prize is the legendary Holy Grail, said to be an omnipotent wish-granting device which will produce any sort of miracle in order to bend reality to accommodate the wishes it grants. The winning Master and Servant shall be granted one wish each, after which the Holy Grail will not be activated until the next War. The 4th Holy Grail War is about to take place, and the 3 preceding Wars had ended without a victor. In pursuit of their individual goals and ambitions, the competing magi congregate at a Japanese city called Fuyuki. All the magi will do anything, rationalize away any atrocity, in pursuit of the Holy Grail. All of them, but one. Kotomine Kirei is a Master, but one without a reason to fight. Unable to release himself from the threads of Fate, he is reluctantly drawn into the War. To enter the War, he even had to stray from his path in the Holy Church and join the ranks of the Mage`s Association, an organization with which the Church is not on good terms, but which it has to tolerate and sometimes even cooperate with. However, as Fate would ironically have it, one of his rival Masters, Emiya Kiritsugu, is a man more merciless than anyone else, an assassin who killed many people and intervened in many conflicts, for reasons no one is able to understand. Kirei`s fight against this interesting yet strange sort of enemy might prove to be his most troubling task so far. Kiritsugu is equally puzzled by Kirei, and both of them still have the other Masters and Servants to take care of.",

The winning Master and Servant shall be granted one wish each, after which the Holy Grail will not be activated until the next War. As the 4th Holy Grail War progresses, several camps raise the stakes, and the challenges only become bigger and more difficult. Each Master and Servant will be faced with the impact of their own shortcomings, and some of the competitors would do well in remembering that deceit and betrayal do not send prior warning...",

Motoko, the president of the Prince Yuki Fan Club, has noticed Yuki smiling more readily, and she isn`t sure how she feels about that – or, for that matter, herself, as she also realizes the ugly obsessiveness of her love for Yuki. Yuki, meanwhile, encounters two individuals who have been chosen to be his chief subordinates on the Student Council: the standoffish Machi and the all-too-gregarious Manabe, both of whom are, in Yuki`s own words, \"Zodiac-level weird.\" Summer break is also approaching.",

Because his unemployed parents are good-for-nothings who waste what money they have on gambling, Hayate had to start working at a young age to help out his family. Although such experience has made him inhumanly fast, tough and skilled at things boys are not normally skilled at, it has also left him in an awkward position, since his parents have racked up such a huge gambling debt that they have sold Hayate to the yakuza for the value of his organs. In a desperate attempt to avoid that fate, Hayate decides to become a \"bad guy\" and kidnap someone to be held for ransom, but his efforts to do so are mistaken for a confession of love by the girl he targets. When he helps save the (as it turns out) very wealthy 13-year-old Nagi from real kidnappers, she takes him in and gives him a job as her new personal butler (and love interest) until he can pay off his debt. But Hayate is more attracted to Nagi`s beautiful teenage maid Maria, and head butler Klaus is initially disapproving of the boy with such a poor look. And then there is Nagi`s pet Tama, who is also a force to be reckoned with.",

Against the backdrop of a setting sun, she runs away, dropping her notebook. Junpei returns the notebook to the student whose name is listed in it, to Toujou Aya, but he is disappointed to find out that she is not the girl that he met on the rooftop. On a dare from his friends, he decides to confess to the most beautiful girl in 3rd year class, Nishino Tsukasa. While her hairstyle is different from the girl of his dreams, she is both very beautiful and she is wearing strawberry panties, so she must have been the girl that he met on the rooftop, or was she?",

    "synopsis": "In the year 2063, space travel is feasible and commercially available. As the cheerful Aries Spring arrives at the spaceport to attend a camp on the distant planet McPa, her purse is suddenly snatched by a reckless thief. Luckily, the athletic Kanata Hoshijima is able to retrieve it for her, and Aries soon discovers that he is among the group of teenagers who will be travelling with her on the excursion as team B-5. Upon arriving at their campsite, the group`s trip takes a turn for the worse when a strange sphere of black light sucks them into the vast reaches of outer space. Stranded with seemingly no hope, they find an abandoned ship nearby that provides them with the means to return home. However, they soon discover that they are not as close to their campsite as they initially thought, but are in fact thousands of light-years away from home. With this realization, the nine members must cautiously manage their resources, maintain their strength, and unite as one to conquer the darkness of space together. While the reason behind their trip`s sudden obstruction remains unknown, they nevertheless embark on the treacherous voyage back home aboard their new ship, the Astra.",

Though his dream of enjoying a new life as an adventurer in an RPG-inspired world and striving to be a hero didn`t come true, he managed to get by in his new world. He was joined by Aqua, the goddess who accompanied him to the parallel world; Megumin, an arch wizard who can only use her magic once a day; and Darkness, a crusader whose attacks always miss. And so, along with his party of girls who have extremely advanced powers but unfortunately can`t take full advantage of them, he managed to complete some quests here and there. Then, one day, after Kazuma`s party saved the town of Axel from the mobile fortress Destroyer, a messenger from the capital came to tell Kazuma that he was suspected of the crime of subversion to the state! Where will the ordinary adventurer Kazuma`s life in a parallel world lead him tomorrow?!",

Shortly after crossing Cagliostro`s borders, Lupin encounters the lovely princess of Cagliostro, hotly pursued by the Duke of Cagliostro`s cronies - and loses her to the Duke`s men who imprison her in his heavily-fortified castle. A bit of inquiry reveals that the Duke has plans to marry the princess against her wishes... and perhaps other plans as well, one involving finding a priceless treasure lost for centuries. A beautiful damsel in distress, an evil Count to be smote, a lost treasure, and the biggest counterfeiting racket on the face of the earth... this is an order just too big for Lupin to resist! But it will take the combined effort of Lupin and all of his friends - Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko, the courageous and selfless Princess herself, and even the relentless Inspector Zenigata - to thwart the Duke`s plans and save the day! Excitement and mayhem are in store!",

    "synopsis": "Two supernatural forces appeared simultaneously on Earth: entrances to another dimension known as Mato, and Peaches, resources that give unique abilities to women. From the Mato come Yomotsu Shuuki, dangerous monsters that leave destruction in their wake. The government`s Anti-demon Corps stands against these creatures, employing women empowered by Peaches to face the monstrous threat. Wakura Yuuki watches these forces clash from a distance, but when he unexpectedly runs afoul of a Yomotsu Shuuki, he`s rescued by Uzen Kyouka, the chief of the Seventh Unit of the Anti-demon Corp—and she sees something in him that could turn the tide of the monster incursion. Yuuki holds the unique power to make Peaches more effective, but he`ll have to become Kyouka`s willing slave to join the fight against the Yomotsu Shuuki and save the world.",

    "synopsis": "Naruto closely follows the life of a boy who is feared and detested by the villagers of the hidden leaf village of Konoha. The distrust of the boy has little to do with the boy himself, but it`s what`s inside him that causes anxiety. Long before Naruto came to be, a Kyuubi (demon fox) with great fury and power waged war taking many lives. The battle ensued for a long time until a man known as the Fourth Hokage, Yondaime, the strongest ninja in Konoha, fiercely fought the Kyuubi. The fight was soon won by Yondaime as he sealed the evil demon in a human body. Thus the boy, Naruto, was born. As Naruto grows he decides to become the strongest ninja in Konoha in an effort to show everyone that he is not as they perceive him to be, but is a human being worthy of love and admiration. But the road to becoming Hokage, the title for the strongest ninja in Konoha, is a long and arduous one. It is a path filled with betrayal, pain, and loss; but with hard work, Naruto may achieve Hokage.",

Satou Tatsuhiro, a 22-year-old socially withdrawn loner, barricades himself in his apartment, subsiding on a meagre allowance sent by his parents, only venturing to the outside world to buy food under cover of darkness. One day, afraid he might miss the utility person, he opens the door to find a cute, mysterious girl, accompanying an elderly religious solicitor. Through what seems to be a chain of coincidences, the girl, Nakahara Misaki, enters Tatsuhiro`s life, and promises him that she will cure him of his anti-social condition, provided that he follows the rules that she sets out for him. This takes Tatsuhiro from a desperate attempt at creating a galge computer game, to unwittingly joining a suicide cult, to participating in a pyramid scheme, to immersing himself in a MMORPG, along the way touching upon everything between hikikomori and otaku culture, existentialism, solipsism, theology, suicide, sacrifice and love.",

One day, however, a suspicious man pursues and stabs Kotona—a catastrophe that Yuu and Haru fail to prevent. While hastily carrying the girl to the hospital, the two boys are nearly hit by a truck but miraculously remain unharmed. Instead, they find themselves in a fairy-tale-like kingdom with an exotic diversity of people and wonderful creatures. To their surprise, the boys discover that Yuu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood, can now walk! Yet they have no time to ponder the puzzling situation, as their friend is gone. Setting off to find Kotona, Yuu and Haru stop at a local pub to inquire about her. But upon inspecting a picture of Asha, the kingdom`s princess, the two have a shocking revelation. Narrating an extraordinary adventure in a magical world, Ni no Kuni demonstrates the special connection between two separate yet parallel worlds and its manifestation of the bonds between individuals.",

    "synopsis": "When Ichijou Hotaru transfers from a school in Tokyo to the tiny little Asahigaoka Branch School in the rural countryside, she should be experiencing major culture shock. After all, there are only three other girls in the school, and none of them are even in the same grade as her. But she quickly finds herself adjusting to spending her time with first grader Renge and the Koshigaya sisters, Natsumi and Komari, who are in the seventh and eighth grade. And the Koshigayas` older brother, the only male student, is not so hard to get along with either. Maybe it does not hurt that Hotaru is a little mature for her age, but there is something about the laid back lifestyle that makes her feel right at home and comfortable. Even if it is 20 minutes by bicycle to the only place that sells comics and the video store is ten train stations away. It is a big change from the big city, but there are still plenty of new adventures to look forward to as Hotaru learns that \"home\" really is where the heart is...",

    "synopsis": "Rentt Faina, a twenty-five-year-old adventurer, has been hacking away at monsters for a decade. However, without much talent for the job, Rentt finds himself stuck hunting Slimes and Goblins for meager amounts of coin every day. Little does he know, all this is about to change when he comes across a seemingly undiscovered path in the Labyrinth of the Moon`s Reflection. What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either— He is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form. Will Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?",

The series features three Rei sisters: one is a child younger than the rest based on Rei 1, the second is based on Rei 2 (the Rei seen for most of the normal series), and the third Rei is actually based on the hyperactive and klutzy Alternate Rei (seen in the alternate-reality dream sequence from the final episode of the original series). Further, Evangelion Unit 01 itself is one of their classmates, but this time as a human-sized robot who acts as something of a class bully. Even the Jet Alone robot is re-imagined as a character on the series.",

Not one to take this turn of events sitting down, Kaoru makes a demand: the power to create potions at any time she pleases, with whatever effect she wants it to have—and it doesn`t stop there either. She asks for a magical Item Box, the ability to understand and speak every language, and the same body she had back when she was a fifteen-year-old girl.

Himura Kenshin, a traveling swordsman who vowed to never kill again on the sakabato (reverse blade sword) he carries on his hip, meets Kamiya Kaoru, the head instructor of the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu sword style. Kenshin solves the case of a crossroad killer who was tarnishing the name of the Kasshin-ryu while claiming to be the \"Hitokiri Battosai,\" which then leads to Kaoru offering to have the wanderer stay at her dojo. Follow Kenshin`s journey as he makes treasured friendships with Myoujin Yahiko, a descendent of a samurai-class family in Tokyo, and Sagara Sanosuke, a fighter for hire, and faces off against various foes who have unfinished business from Kenshin`s past.",

    "synopsis": "Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

    "synopsis": "In the year 2015, the Angels, huge, tremendously powerful, alien war machines, appear in Tokyo for the second time. The only hope for mankind`s survival lies in the Evangelion, a humanoid fighting machine developed by NERV, a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelions` one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with an Evangelion. One such teenager is Ikari Shinji, whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelions. Thrust into a maelstrom of battles and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything. * The original TV series, episodes 1-20 * The Director`s Cut of episodes 21-24 of the original TV series * Death(True)^2, released on the ninth disc with the label of Revival of Evangelion * The End of Evangelion, released on the tenth disc, with the label Evangelion – The Feature Film",

    "synopsis": "Originally a collection of clips from the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series, Death was created as a precursor to the re-worked ending of the series. Rebirth was intended as that reworked ending, but after production overruns Rebirth became only the first half of the first episode of The End of Evangelion, with some minor differences. Over time, two newer director`s cuts of Death were produced, each including new footage not seen in the series - these were called Death(True) and finally Death(True)^2. * Death(True) aired on 02.01.1998 on the Japanese satellite TV channel WOWOW. This version of Evangelion: Death was personally re-edited by Masayuki, removing much of the new footage from episodes 21-24 that was contained in the original Death release. * Death(True)^2 was released on 08.03.1998 as part of the Revival of Evangelion release, which is a unification of the movies Death(True)^2 (a further edit of Death(True), with a few removed shots edited back in) and The End of Evangelion. Note that despite containing clips from the series, Death(True)^2 & Rebirth should be seen after the main TV series itself to be fully understood. * The original TV series, episodes 1-20 * The Director`s Cut of episodes 21-24 of the original TV series * Death(True)^2, released on the ninth disc with the label of Revival of Evangelion * The End of Evangelion, released on the tenth disc, with the label Evangelion – The Feature Film",

    "synopsis": "Miyamori Aoi and her high school animation club friends share a dream they all pledge to turn into reality: getting jobs in the anime industry and eventually coming together once more to create a professional anime they can be proud of. To that end, their first step is the production of their club`s very own amateur anime, which gets screened during the school`s cultural festival. Two and a half years later, Aoi has a production assistant job at Musashino Animation, or Musani for short, a once relevant animation company that fell from grace and is now making its first anime in many years. Animator Yasuhara Ema, one of Aoi`s clubmates, has also landed a job at Musani, where she is a keyframer. They find, however, that creating anime professionally is far more demanding than they had thought when they were still high schoolers, and Exodus!, the anime they`re working on, shoulders a responsibility that leaves no room for issues. Meanwhile, their friends from the club days also struggle in their own ways: Toudou Misa is a CG artist with a job that consists of drawing car parts only, Sakaki Shizuka has studied to be a seiyuu but is still only trying hard to land anything better than walk-on parts while juggling a waitress part-time job, and Imai Midori, who wishes to be a scriptwriter, is still a student and hasn`t even begun to walk the path towards an industry job yet. In an industry where the budget is small, the schedule is constrained, people overwork themselves to meet absurd deadlines, and something is always ready to come out of left field and wreak havoc on what little order there was, those five friends fight on towards their dream. Whether this dream was just a fleeting teenage passion that will get hammered by reality or whether they will be able to pursue it while adapting to the difficulties remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Exodus! has many issues that seem impossible to solve, but Aoi still needs to solve a number of them, and soon, because the airing of the anime she`s working on depends on it!",

While life there may appear stale on the surface, the children are full of potential and curiosity. In many ways it is like a slice of heaven. The outside world is a hell-scape. It is almost entirely void of anything mechanical and is now inhabited by bizarre, yet powerful super-natural beings. Maru, with the aid of Kiruko, is out there crisscrossing what was once Tokyo for heaven. But after searching for so long, maybe heaven is more of an untenable dream than a potential reality.",

For some reason, she`s also taken on the responsibility of reprimanding the slacker who sits next to her in class. Kuze Masachika is constantly frustrating her by falling asleep, forgetting his textbooks, and just being an overall unexemplary student. Or at least, that`s how it looks from the outside. She may put on a tough act, but she doesn`t mind Masachika as much as others would think. She even lets him call her by her nickname, Alya. Anyone hearing the comments she mutters in Russian under her breath might know how she really feels, but since none of her classmates understand the language, she`s free to say whatever she likes! Except...there is one person who knows what she`s saying. Masachika eavesdrops on her embarrassing revelations, pretending to be clueless, all the while wondering what her flirtatious comments actually mean!",

Takasu Ryuuji is frustrated with the way he looks as he enters his second year of high school, for despite his gentle personality, he actually looks like an intimidating delinquent. Thus he does not see his chances of getting a girlfriend improving any time soon, and does not have many close friends either. After being greeted by his hungover mother in the morning, Ryuuji goes to school and finds out that he is in the same class as his best friend Kitamura Yuusaku. But what makes him extremely happy is that he gets to be in the same class as his crush Kushieda Minori. However, it is then that he unexpectedly bumps into Aisaka Taiga — the creature ranked most dangerous in the school — who goes by the nickname Palmtop Tiger and also just happens to be in his class. Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and will not hesitate to snap at people. After a series of misunderstandings between Ryuuji and Taiga, Ryuuji is taken in by Taiga as her personal servant. Taiga had moved out to live on her own due to family issues and is inept at doing household chores. After discovering the state of her apartment Ryuuji, who has a real talent for domestic chores, decides to do all of her house work. Taiga spends a lot of her time over at his house, so much so that she could almost be considered a member of his family. And since Ryuuji spends a lot of time with Taiga, he opens up to her world and to a side of her that most people do not see. The two also attempt to help each other in order to improve their relationship with their respective crushes — Taiga has a crush on Ryuuji`s best friend, Yuusaku, and Ryuuji has a crush on Taiga`s best friend, Minori. However, fellow students start to become curious about their strange relationship together and rumours begin to spread about them...",

One evening, after Yuki thinks she`s ended her stream, she cracks a few cold ones—and more than a few crude jokes—while watching Live-On`s video archives. But her viewers hear it all, and clips of her bawdy, drunken commentary go viral overnight. Yuki thinks her career is over...until her manager reveals that everyone at Live-On has been waiting for her to snap all along and gives her free rein to drink on-stream. Now free of all feigned purity, she jumps right into her new \"rowdy drunk\" character and is welcomed into the fold by her fellow Live-On VTubers, who turn out to be just as crazy as she is! With her views and finances skyrocketing, Yuki`s work—for the first time in her life—is actually fun!",

If she manages to survive a series of fabric-shredding fights with titillating teachers, sultry stewardesses, and mesmerising maidens of the moe variety, Aya`s every wish will be granted by a mysterious jewel known as the Platonic Heart. But if she goes down for the count, she will join the growing ranks of brutally bruised yet resiliently buxom beauties that are never heard from again!",
