# Proxy Functionalities Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the proxy functionalities implemented in the `aniflame-api` project. These functionalities are not original code but are derived from open-source contributions. The primary source of these functionalities is the `Anify` project, specifically from the `anify-backend` repository.

## Source Code

The original source code for the proxy functionalities can be found in the `Anify` project, under the `anify-backend` repository. The specific files related to proxy functionalities are located in the `src/proxies` directory. The key files include:

- `checkProxies.ts`: Contains the logic for checking the availability and functionality of proxies.
- `scrapeProxies.ts`: Implements the scraping of proxies from web pages.

## Integration into `aniflame-api`

The proxy functionalities from the `Anify` project have been integrated into the `aniflame-api` project to enhance its capabilities in managing and utilizing proxies. These functionalities are crucial for the efficient operation of the API, especially in scenarios where direct connections to external services are required.

### Checking Proxies

The `checkProxies.ts` file provides a mechanism to verify the availability and functionality of proxies before they are used. This ensures that the API can operate reliably and efficiently by only using valid proxies.

### Fetching Proxies

The `fetchProxies.ts` file is responsible for retrieving proxies from various sources. This functionality is essential for maintaining a pool of proxies that the API can use for its operations.

### Scraping Proxies

The `scrapeProxies.ts` file implements the logic for scraping proxies from web pages. This is particularly useful for dynamically updating the pool of proxies based on the latest available options.

## Conclusion

The integration of proxy functionalities from the `Anify` project into the `aniflame-api` project has significantly enhanced its capabilities in managing proxies. This integration is a testament to the power of open-source collaboration and the importance of leveraging existing solutions to build more robust and efficient applications.
